# Projective nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) in R

R package implementing projective NMF described in ("Linear and Nonlinear Projective Nonnegative Matrix Factorization", Z. Yang and E. Oja, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks)[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.216.571&rep=rep1&type=pdf].

Implentation is derived from the (author's matlab
code)[https://sites.google.com/site/zhirongyangcs/pnmf] and uses the R
NMF package infrastructure, offering a range of seeding and diagnostic tools.
